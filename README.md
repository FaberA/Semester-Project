# Semester-Project


   This is a Hospital/Patient/Doctor registry management utility. All values are stored in a derby database as well as within built in objects. The GUI was made using JavaFX and SceneBuilder. In its current version the utility allows users to add and/or delete new patients or doctors. There are currently two types of patients (inpatient / outpatient) and both have different patient ailment possibilities. Future functionality should be creating a list or map to match patients to a doctor and vice-versa.
